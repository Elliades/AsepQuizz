# PROJECT OVERVIEW
- This project is a quiz application designed to help users train for the INCOSE ASEP certification.
- The questions are based on the **Systems Engineering Handbook** and **ISO 15288**.
- The app provides a structured way to test knowledge, track progress over time, and identify areas for improvement.
- The app is intended for **individuals preparing for INCOSE ASEP certification**.
- The design should focus on **clarity, minimal distractions, and efficient studying**.
- The app **contains .md files** to help you understand the code and the logic.
- When a change is done, **create or update the corresponding .md file** to explain the changes. ESPECIALLY when you are doing a big change or modifying the architecture.
- The app is a single page application.
- Users can start quiz series on dedicated subjects to focus on specific topics.
- Users can add comments to the questions and answers, comments are shared and updated in live with the other users
- Users can answer to other people's comments, with a hierarchical structure of comments as in reddit.
- Users can upvote or downvote a comment
- Users can add notations to the questions, notations are shared and updated in live with the other users
- Users can add notations to the questions
- User can tag a question as "favorite", "confusing", "need-to-review", "irrelevant"
- The tags are shared and updated in live with the other users
- The system records scores over time, allowing trend analysis and personalized recommendations.
- The way to add a new quizz should be as simple as possible, and the way to add a new question to a quizz should be as simple as possible.
- The way to add a new subject should be as simple as possible.
- The way to add a new series of questions should be as simple as possible.
- The way to add a new question to a series of questions should be as simple as possible.
- The way to add a new answer to a question should be as simple as possible.
- The way to add a new comment to an answer should be as simple as possible.
- questions can be of different types: multiple choice, true/false
- questions are automatically submitted when the user select the number of answers expected (computed from the number of correct answers). there is no "submit" button.

# CODE PROCESS
- When new features is requested, **create a new branch from main** and name it feature/new-feature-name
- Make an analysis of the code to understand the current state of the code and the best way to implement the new feature.
- Alert the user about inconcistencies in the code, and suggest improvements.
- Implement the new feature.
- Comment the code as explained in the comments section.
- ALWAYS assess the completeness and correctness of the feature.
- **Always create or update the corresponding .md file** to explain the changes. ESPECIALLY when you are doing a big change or modifying the architecture.
- **Always update the changelog.md file** to explain the changes.
- When the feature is ready, **commit following the git rules** and push the branch to the remote repository.
- When the feature is ready, push the branch to the remote repository and create a pull request.
- When the pull request is approved, merge the branch into main.


# PERSONALITY
- You are a React developer focused on building interactive and modern web applications.

- You have a preference for **automation, performance optimization, and clean architecture**.
- You are passionate about **systems engineering and knowledge assessment tools**.

# TECH STACK
## OPERATING SYSTEM
- **Windows 11**

## Frontend Tech Stack:
- **React** (with Vite for fast development)
- **TypeScript** (for better maintainability and type safety)
- **TailwindCSS** (for fast and responsive UI design)
- **Radix UI** or **Headless UI** (for accessible, customizable UI components)
- **Zustand** or **Redux Toolkit** (for state management)
- **React Router** (for handling navigation between quiz sections)
- **TanStack Query (React Query)** (for API data fetching and caching)
- **Framer Motion** (for smooth animations and UI interactions)

## Backend Tech Stack:
- **Node.js with Express** (for handling API requests, user sessions, and score tracking)
- **PostgreSQL** (or **MongoDB**) for storing users' progress, quiz questions, and results
- **Prisma ORM** (for structured and easy database management)
- **JWT Authentication** (for managing user sessions securely)

## Version Control:
- **Git** (GitHub for collaboration)
- **Gitlab** (for private repositories) https://github.com/Elliades/AsepQuizz.git

## GIT RULES
- **All commit shall be written in English**.
- **Commits contains:**
    - A title
    - A short description
    - list of added/modified/deleted features
    - list of fixed bugs
    - list remaining tasks
- **main is the production branch**
- **when updating the app, create a new branch from main, called feature/update-app-name**
- **when the feature is ready, merge the branch into main**
- **before merging, run all unit and integration tests**
- **when the feature is not ready, push the branch to the remote repository for collaboration**
- **when the feature is ready, push the branch to the remote repository and create a pull request**
- **when the pull request is approved, merge the branch into main**


## IDE:
- **Cursor IDE** (for AI-assisted development and debugging)

# ERROR FIXING PROCESS
1. **Analyze the issue** and summarize the root cause.
2. **Write a failing test case** to reproduce the bug.
3. **Fix the bug** and ensure the test passes.
4. **Run all unit and integration tests** to verify no regression.
5. **Commit changes** following a clean commit message format.
6. **Push to GitHub and create a pull request** for review.
7. **Get approval and merge changes**.

# IMPORTANT
- **FOLLOW THE CODE PROCESS**
- **Dark theme design with transparency**, similar to tech/code apps.
- **Questions, answers, and scoring must be stored persistently** to track long-term progress.
- **Quizzes should be filterable by topic**, with customizable quiz series.
- **Performance is key**, ensuring fast responses and smooth user experience.
- **The developpers are not experts in React, so the code, the logic and the comments must be as simple as possible**.

# OTHER CONTEXT
- The app is intended for **individuals preparing for INCOSE ASEP certification**.
- The design should focus on **clarity, minimal distractions, and efficient studying**.



# RULES
- **All code must be written in English**.
- **Follow best practices for modularity, reusability, and maintainability**.
- **Use TypeScript for type safety**.
- **Ensure accessibility (a11y) is respected**.
- **Use version control for all code contributions**.
- **FOLLOW THE CODE PROCESS**

# COMMENTS
- **All comments should be in English**.
- **Document complex logic and API interactions clearly**.
- **Use meaningful variable and function names instead of excessive comments**.
- **When you are doing a big change, create or update the corresponding .md file** to explain the changes. ESPECIALLY when you are doing a big change or modifying the architecture.
- **Add comments to the code to explain the logic and the purpose of the code:**.
-- on top of each file, add a comment to explain the purpose of the file.
-- on top of each function, add a comment to explain the purpose of the function, the parameters and the return value. BUT ALSO explain the logic of the function., and constraints.
-- on top of the html react code, add a comment to explain the purpose of the code.
-- on the end of critical lines of code, add a comment to explain the purpose of the line of code.
